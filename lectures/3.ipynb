    "Originally designed for fast graphics calculations, they have found use in accelerating many kinds of numerical code. The defining characteristic of these processors has been their ability to run many threads (in the order of hundreds or thousands) in parallel, which then allows significant speedups in algorithms that can take advantage of this facility. Therefore, the general-purpose Graphics Processing Unit (__GPU__) has turned out to be one of the best ways of running fast parallel computations.  \n",

    "## CPUs vs GPUs\n",
    "In CPUs the majority of silicon is dedicated to several ALUs and large caches. Moreover the memory hierarchy is organised in order to have very large DRAM and very fast and large cache memories (Registers, L1, L2, L3). Modern CPUs often have multiple cores on chip: each core has registers and ALU units to run a thread independently from other cores. When there are more threads on the fly than available cores, the operating system can make a __context switch__: the running thread is freezed and all information about its status is saved and put back for later restore. Then a new thread take the hardware resources, load its previous status and restart its flow until a new context switch will take place. This mechanism is optimized to __minimize latencies__. From this point of view CPUs tend to have tens of software threads at a time and perform task parallelism.\n",
    "\n",
    "In GPUs the majority of silicon is dedicated to thousands of ALUs and each have its own control units and registers. The memory hierarchy is organised with high bandwidth DRAM and several cache memories whose storage capability is limited with respect to CPU ones. GPU scheduler organizes the work to do in SMs by grouping 32 threads in __warps__.  32 warps are called __thread blocks__ and are collected to fit __grid size__. GPU architecture __hides latencies__ with computation from thousands of other thread warps and tend to perform more a data parallelism. Several warps are mapped to an SM, and a SM instantaneously switches between the warps of a block. So each warp needs separate registers for each of its threads. Every block in a grid contains the same number of threads.\n",

    "- Find __stalls__, where the CPU isn't submitting work fast enough to keep the GPU busy;  \n",
    "- __Memory optimizations__ are the most important area for performance. Hence optimizing memory accesses, e.g., avoiding needless global accesses (buffering in shared memory instead) and coalescing accesses can lead to big performance improvements;  \n",
    "- Launching more threads on each streaming multiprocessor can be achieved by __lowering register pressure__ and __reducing shared memory usage__;  \n",
    "- __Using Float32's instead of Float64's__ can provide significantly better performance;  \n",

    "- __Inlining__ can reduce register usage and thus speed up kernels. To force inlining of all functions use `@cuda always_inline=true`;\n",
    "- The number of threads that can be launched is partly determined by the number of registers a kernel uses. This is due to registers being shared between all threads on a multiprocessor. __Setting the maximum number of registers per thread__ will force less registers to be used which can increase thread count at the expense of having to spill registers into local memory, this may improve performance. To set the max registers to 32 use `@cuda max_registers=32`;  \n",
